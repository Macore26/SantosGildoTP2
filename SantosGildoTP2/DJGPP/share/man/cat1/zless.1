       _Z_l_e_s_s is a filter which allows examination  of  compressed
       or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy
       terminal.  It is the equivalent of setting the environment
       variable LESSOPEN to "|gzip -cdfq -- %s", and then running
       _l_e_s_s.  However, enough people seem to  think  that  having
       the  command _z_l_e_s_s available is important to be worth pro-
       viding it.

       _Z_l_e_s_s does not work with compressed data that is piped  to
       it  via  standard  input;  it requires that input files be
       specified as arguments.
