This is a port of GNU Patch 2.5.9 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, readme files,
        etc.) are located in the /djgpp subdir. The dir /pc/djgpp contains
        djgpp specific files shipped with the original FSF distribution and
        are no longer used.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory
        and unzip it running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 pat259b.zip      or
          djtarx pat259b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d pat259b.zip

        For futher information about GNU Patch please read the man page.


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (patch level 1, see the djdev203.dsm)
          bsh204b.zip, gcc410b.zip, bnu2161b.zip, mak3791b.zip,
          fil41b.zip, shl2011b.zip, txt20b.zip, txi48b.zip,
          grep24b.zip, sed415b.zip and dif287b.zip.

        All this packages can be found in the v2gnu directory of ftp.delorie.com
        and any mirror. The above cited packages are those ones I have used to
        build the binaries from this sources. Previuos versions of those packages
        may do the job as well but I have not tested this.

3.2.:   Create a temporary directory. Copy the source package: pat259s.zip
        into the directory and unzip it runnig ONE of the following commands:
          unzip32 pat259s.zip      or
          djtarx pat259s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d pat259s.zip

3.3.:   This package does not have NLS support.
        If for some reason you want to reconfigure the package cd into the top
        srcdir (patch-2.5-9) and run the following commands:
          del djgpp\config.cache
          make distclean
          djgpp\config

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the djgpp
        subdir or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.
        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\patch-2.5-9\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/patch-2.5-9

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\patch-2.5-9\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/patch-2.5-9

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter. You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.ins and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.


3.4.:   To compile the package run from the top srcdir the command:
          make

3.5.:   To install the binary, info docs and man pages run the following command
        from the top srcdir:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR". If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value.
        Example:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/dir
