This is a port of GNU Gzip 1.3.9 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

      - This port is completely based on Eli Zaretskii's port of GNU Gzip 1.2.4a
        (aka gzp124a?.zip). The means, that all the djgpp specific funtionality
        introduced with gzp124a?.zip will also be available in this new port.
      - This port is based on the alpha release of GNU Gzip available at:
             <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.3.9.tar.gz>
      - All the changes done to the original distribution are documented in the
        diffs file and located together with all the files needed to configure
        the package (config.bat, config.sed and config.site) in the djgpp subdir.

        This is a recompilation of all new features introduced with gzp124a?
        and also available in this port:
      - Gzip now fully supports long file names on those platforms where DJGPP
        can access them. This means, for example, that compressing `foo.tar' on
        Windows 9X will produce `foo.tar.gz', not `foo.tgz'.
        For backward compatibility, Gzip knows about butchered DOS-style
        extensions of compressed files even when long file names are supported.
        For example, if you have `foo.tgz' and you type "gunzip foo.tar", Gzip
        will find the file even on Windows 9X. Short variants of compressed
        extensions are checked *after* the long ones, so Gzip will try to find
        `foo.tar.gz' before `foo.tgz'.
        Long file name support is checked for each file submitted to Gzip, so
        it will treat each one of them in accordance with the properties of the
        file system where that file resides. In other words, you can compress
        files that reside on DOS and Windows file systems within a single Gzip
        command.
      - Gzip will no longer appear to hang when its input comes from the console
        device. Previous ports would hang when the user typed "gzip -f [Enter]".
        This port allows you to either interrupt the program with Ctrl-C (if you
        typed that command by mistake), or type in the input and end it with a ^Z
        (if you really mean to compress the text you type from the keyboard).
        This is done by avoiding to switch the console device to binary mode,
        so any console reads are now done in text mode.
      - The default compressed file extension is now `.gz', not `z'. This is so
        that compressed file names on Windows 9X would have the usual `.gz'
        extension, but it also means that `foo.cc' will now be compressed into
        `foo.cgz' when long file names are not supported.  Use the -N option to
        `gunzip' to restore the original name, if the original file name had
        more than one character in the extension.
      - When restoring original file names, `gunzip' now converts all characters
        that are not allowed in DOS/Windows file names to similar but valid
        characters, and changes the file name if it is reserved by a DOS device
        driver (like `aux.text' or `prn.tar') by prepending an underscore to it.
      - In previous ports, uncompressing files with certain names on Windows 9X
        when numeric tails are disabled would trigger false warnings about file
        name truncation. This is now fixed.
      - Truncation of long file names on plain DOS is somewhat smarter now:
        `gunzip' treats several additional characters (like `-' and `_') as
        part delimiters.
      - Shell scripts `zmore', `zdiff', `zgrep' and others now work on DOS and
        Windows, and are distributed with the binary distribution, as are all
        the man pages supplied with the official GNU sources.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory
        and unzip it running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 gzip139b.zip      or
          djtarx gzip139b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d gzip139b.zip

        For futher information about GNU Gzip please read the info docs,
        man pages and the README, NEWS and ChangeLog files.


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (NOT a prior version)
          bsh204b.zip gcc343b.zip, bnu215b.zip,
          mak3791b.zip, fil41b.zip, shl112b.zip,
          txt20b.zip, txi47b.zip, grep24b.zip
          and sed412b.zip.


        All this packages can be found in the v2gnu directory of any
        Simtel.NET mirror.
        Later versions of all these packages will to the job as well.

3.2.:   Create a temporary directory. Copy the source package: gzip139s.zip
        into the directory and unzip it runnig ONE of the following commands:
          unzip32 gzip139s.zip      or
          djtarx gzip139s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d gzip139s.zip

3.3.:   This package is already preconfigured for djdev203. To compile the
        sources run the command:
          make

        To install the products run the command:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP directory tree specified
        by the value of DJDIR. If you prefer to install into some other dir,
        then run the following command:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/dir

        This will install the products into the directory specified by the value
        of prefix.

3.4.:   If for some reason you want to reconfigure the package, change into the
        top srcdir (gzip-1.3-9), delete the config.cache file located in the
        djgpp subdir and run the following commands:
          make distclean
          djgpp\config

        Please note that you MUST delete the config.cache file or you will not
        be reconfiguring your package because the configuration informations
        will be read from the cache file instead of being newly computed.
        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\gzip-1.3-9\djgpp\configdj x:/src/gnu/gzip-1.3-9

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a 
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\gzip-1.3-9\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/gzip-1.3-9
