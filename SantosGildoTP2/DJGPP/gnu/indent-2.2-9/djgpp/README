This is a port of GNU Indent 2.2.9 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

      - The profole file name has been modified from `.indent.pro' to `indent.pro'.
      - Indent generate numbered backups if the used OS supports long file names.
        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, readme files,
        etc.) are located in the djgpp subdir.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory
        and unzip it running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 ind229b.zip      or
          djtarx ind229b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d ind229b.zip

2.2.:   If there is no entry for the indent info docs in your dir file, located
        info directory, create one running the command:
          install-info --info-dir=/dev/env/DJDIR/info /dev/env/DJDIR/info/indent.info

        For futher information about GNU Indent please read the info docs.
        Indent has *a lot* of options, so you should study them carefully
        to tailor them to your personal preferences and coding style.
        (If you prefer the GNU indentation style, most options are already
        set for you by default.)

2.3.:   If you want to make your style preferences the default, consider
        creating your own profile file.  This is called `indent.pro' and
        should be either in the current directory or in your ``home''
        directory. The former option allows for each project to have its
        own indentation style, while the latter is a vehicle to set a global
        default. Since MS-DOS systems generally don't have home directories
        for users, you will need to set the environment variable HOME to
        point to the directory where your `indent.pro' is kept. I suggest to
        define it on your DJGPP.ENV file, like so:

       [indent]
       HOME=%DJDIR%/share

       This defines the value of HOME only for `indent', so it won't
       interfere with any other programs which use that variable.
       After editing DJGPP.ENV, make sure the directory `share' indeed
       exists under the root of DJGPP installation tree, then put your
       `indent.pro' into that directory.

       (Note that the above two lines should also be flushed to the
       left margin, or else they won't work.)


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (patch level 1, see the djdev203.dsm)
          bsh204b.zip, gcc331b.zip, bnu213b.zip, mak3791b.zip,
          fil41b.zip, shl2011b.zip, txt20b.zip, txi46b.zip,
          grep24b.zip, sed409b.zip, dif28b.zip, gprf301b.zip
          and tx2h164b.zip

        All this packages can be found in the v2gnu directory of ftp.delorie.com
        and any mirror. The above cited packages are those ones I have used to
        build the binaries from this sources. Previuos versions of those packages
        may do the job as well but I have not tested this.

3.2.:   Create a temporary directory. Copy the source package: ind229s.zip
        into the directory and unzip it runnig ONE of the following commands:
          unzip32 ind229s.zip      or
          djtarx ind229s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d ind229s.zip

3.3.:   This package does not have NLS support.
        If for some reason you want to reconfigure the package cd into the top
        srcdir (indent-2.2-9) and run the following commands:
          del djgpp\config.cache
          make distclean
          djgpp\config

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the djgpp
        subdir or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.
        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\indent-2.2-9\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/indent-2.2-9

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\indent-2.2-9\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/indent-2.2-9

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter. You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.ins and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.


3.4.:   To compile the package run from the top srcdir the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like. Cd from the top srcdir into the
        regression dir and run the command:
          sh ./TEST

        Non test should fail.
        Please note that the testsuit does not work on plain DOS. There are no
        intensions to fix this issue.

3.6.:   To install the binary, info docs and man pages run the following command
        from the top srcdir:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR". If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value.
        Example:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/dir

3.7.:   If you like follow the suggestions given in 2.3.



        Send sed specific bug reports to <bug-indent@gnu.org>.
        Send suggestions and bug reports concerning the DJGPP port
        to comp.os.msdos.djgpp or <djgpp@delorie.com>.

Enjoy.
