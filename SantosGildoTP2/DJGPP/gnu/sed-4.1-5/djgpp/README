This is a port of GNU Sed 4.1.5 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

      - If this sources are compiled with djdev204 (2004-11-25) or prior
        faulty code for the e (evaluate) command will be produced due to a
        bug in the popen() and pclose() code. This has been fixed and this
        package contains a copy of popen.c from the actual cvs tree of djdev204
        that will be compiled in to get a working sed binary for use on WinXP.
        The popen() and pclose() bug only concerns djdev204. If you compile the
        sources with stock djdev203 then the included popen.c file will be
        ignored and the popen and pclose functions from djdev203's libc will be
        used to create the binary.
        The distributed binaries have been compiled with djdev203.
      - A patch to open the input stream in binary mode. This will allow to
        process files that contain embedded ^Z and lone ^M characters.
      - If you have no DJGPP port of Sed installed and you want to rebuild this
        package from sources, please read Eli Zaretskii's readme file called:
        README.ORIG located in the djgpp directory. This explicitely explains
        how to build the binaries from the source package if no sed executable
        is installed.
        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, readme files,
        etc.) are located in the djgpp subdir.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory
        and unzip it running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 sed415b.zip      or
          djtarx sed415b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d sed415b.zip

2.2.:   If there is no entry for the sed info docs in your dir file, located
        info directory, create one running the command:
          install-info --info-dir=/dev/env/DJDIR/info /dev/env/DJDIR/info/sed.info

        For futher information about GNU Sed please read the info docs and the NEWS file.


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (patch level 2, see the djdev203.dsm)
          bsh204b.zip, gcc343b.zip, bnu215b.zip, mak3791b.zip,
          fil41b.zip, shl2011b.zip, txt20b.zip, txi47b.zip,
          grep24b.zip, sed3028b.zip and dif281b.zip.

        All this packages can be found in the v2gnu directory of ftp.delorie.com
        and any mirror. The above cited packages are those ones I have used to
        build the binaries from this sources. Previuos versions of those packages
        may do the job as well but I have not tested this.

3.2.:   Create a temporary directory. Copy the source package: sed415s.zip
        into the directory and unzip it runnig ONE of the following commands:
          unzip32 sed415s.zip      or
          djtarx sed415s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d sed415s.zip

3.3.:   This package does not have NLS support.
        Due to difficulties with djdev204 (2004-11-25) to config.bat files are
        distributed. The normal one called:
          config.bat
        must be used to configure the sources if you are using stock djdev203.
        The second one called:
          xp-config.bat
        must be used if you are configuring the sources with djdev204. This
        batch file will include in the to be compiled sources a copy of popen.c
        from the actual cvs tree of djdev204. This will allow you to generate a
        working sed binary for WinXP.
        If for some reason you want to reconfigure the package cd into the top
        srcdir (sed-4.1-5) and run the following commands:
          del djgpp\config.cache
          make distclean
          djgpp\config  or  djgpp\xp-config

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the /djgpp
        subdir or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.
        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.1-5\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.1-5
        or:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.1-5\djgpp\xp-config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.1-5

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.1-5\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.1-5
        or:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.1-5\djgpp\xp-config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.1-5

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter. You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.ins and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.


3.4.:   To compile the package run from the top srcdir the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like. From the top srcdir run the
        command:
          make check

        No one of the tests should fail no matter if you have used stock djdev203
        or beta djdev204.

3.6.:   To install the binary, info docs and man pages run the following command
        from the top srcdir:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR". If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value.
        Example:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/dir
